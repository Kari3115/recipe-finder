						<h4>Who are the Users?</h4>
						 Basically, some users will be non-members who will be able to access the site but only will be able to search for recipes, whereas the registered members will be the main users who will be authorized to use all features of the Recipe Finder website including search, create, modify and delete for the recipes.<br><br>
						 <h4>What should users expect?</h4>
						 My main intention to build this website is to encourage users to try something new and get good hands-on cooking experience with a variety of multi-cuisine recipes.<br><br>
						 <h4>What user problems will be solved?</h4>
						 Many people face the issue of eating the same boring food everyday, especially the people who don't possess good cooking related ideas and skills, so I feel this website would help them create new dishes and help bring some changes in their daily mundane schedule.<br><br>
						 <h4>What actions should users take after using this website?</h4>
						 I strongly anticipate that if this website is used often and integrated in the daily schedule, the takeaways for the users would be that they will get accustomed to cooking a variety of dishes which they thought they would never be able to cook! Also, this is a fun way to learn cooking as the users can also add their own innovations to an existing recipe as well as will be able to create their own new recipe and share with the Recipe Finder member community. This will be a new experience altogether!<br><br>
