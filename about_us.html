						Section 1 - About who you are<br>
						My name is Karishma and I am a current Computer Science graduate student. I would like to describe myself as a fun-loving and an easy-going person, I enjoy dancing, sketching, reading crime fiction, listening to music and binge-watching Netflix series. <br>
						Additionally, I enjoy challenging myself in various situations, always curious to explore and learn new things and meet new people.<br><br>
						Section 2 - Project Description and why you chose this project<br>
						This is a Recipe Finder website which has a search feature that helps users look up different recipes whenever they are tired of daily tedious meals. The intention of building this website is that I am a big foodie and sometimes rely on Youtube videos to make something special. 
						So I feel this project will be pretty helpful to the users who are foodies like me and open to experiment. Also, there is an option to create, modify and delete the recipes which have been added by the existing members and only the members can create or make changes to those recipes.<br><br>
						Section 3 - Description of technology used for your site<br>
						Recipe Finder is a simple website built using HTML, CSS, Ajax and Javascript that uses Amazon DynamoDB as database. It has navigation links to multiple pages which give a good overall understanding of the website. GitHub Pages has been used to host it.<br><br>
						Section 4 - What have you learned in this class<br>
						Throughout this course I have learnt various technologies related to front-end development like HTML, CSS, jQuery, Ajax, and AWS and how to make the website to integrate foundations for dynamic functionality . As the curriculum was very well-structured, I got to learn a wide scope of skills and gained a good amount of hands-on experience while completing the assignments. Overall, I would say that this course was very useful in providing basic understanding and skills that go behind building a full-fledged website.
